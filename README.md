### Frest - PWA Restaurant Reviewer

A progressive web app (PWA) created following a udacity.com course.

### Local Development

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 
1. Make sure you install all the node dependencies by running `npm install`
1. This project uses webpack and babel to transpile the JS files, so running `npm run build` it's necessary to get the x_bundle.js files in order to run the latest version of the app.

1. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

1. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
